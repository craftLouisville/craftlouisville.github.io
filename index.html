                            CRAFT is an experience designed to capture elements of what makes Louisville special and
                            combine them into a single night. While CRAFT began as a small group of people looking to do their
                            part to cure cystic fibrosis, it has grown into one of the premier parties in the entire city.

                            Louisville is CRAFT. Craft venues, craft food, craft music, craft art, craft entertainment, craft beer
                            and so much more have helped put our city on the map. Now all of these elements come together in
                            a single night that celebrates the culture of a city and the fight for a cure.

                            It's a party with a purpose! Together, we'll dine on pizza from many of the best craft pizza makers in
                            the city, sip on craft beer from local breweries flowing from never-ending taps, dance the night away
                            listening to some of the top local bands and raise money that will help end this awful disease.

                            <strong>About Cystic Fibrosis</strong><br />
                            About cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease that primarily affects the
                            lungs and digestive system. An estimated 30,000 children and adults in the United States (70,000
                            worldwide) have CF. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are able
                            to attend school and work, and have a better quality of life than in previous decades. With the help of
                            the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and donors like you, people with CF are able now live into their 20s
                            and 30s, and some are living into their 40s and 50s.

                            <strong>Important Note on Attendance at CURE CF, Inc Events:</strong> To reduce the risk of getting and spreading germs at CURE CF, Inc-sponsored events,
                            we ask that everyone follow basic best practices by regularly cleaning your hands with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand gel, covering your
                            cough or sneeze with a tissue or your inner elbow and maintaining a safe 6-foot distance from anyone with a cold or infection.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align:left;width:90%;margin:0px auto 0px auto;padding-bottom:1em;">
                            Medical evidence shows that germs may spread among people with CF through direct and indirect contact as well as through droplets that travel short distances
                            when a person coughs or sneezes. These germs can lead to worsening symptoms and speed decline in lung function. To further help reduce the risk of cross-infection,
                            the CURE CF Inc's attendance policy recommends inviting only one person with CF to attend any indoor portion of a Foundation-sponsored event at a specific time.
                            For any outdoor portion, the Foundation recommends that all people with CF maintain a safe 6-foot distance from each other at all times. Also, individuals who have
                            ever had a confirmed positive sputum culture for Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) complex should not attend events.

                            In early 2015, a small group of parents who didn’t know each other particularly well, decided to meet
                            over a cold beer at a local brewery in Louisville, KY.  The one thing we had in common... kids
                            battling cystic fibrosis.  That night the Klausings (Luke ­ 8 years old at the time), the Foushees (Alex ­ 2 years
                            old at the time) and the Sweeneys (Samuel ­ 8 months old at the time) decided to work tirelessly to rally their city to join the
                            fight to save their kids and beat CF once and for all.
                        </p>

                            We knew that in order to tap into the heart of this city, we had to design an event that embodied the
                            very best of what Louisville has to offer.  It didn’t take us long to realize that all of the pieces to make
                            a great event already existed right here: the pizza, the beer, the people and a whole lot of asks.

                            What started as a small group of dedicated parents has grown into a small army of friends, family,
                            businesses and even local government.  Together, for one night each year, we’re going to bring it all
                            together to throw the best party this town has ever seen, raise some serious dollars to battle CF and
                            celebrate another year of Louisville’s drive towards a cure.

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/team/Luke Champion.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
                                Watching 8 year old Luke on the playground or at football practice, you would never guess he was battling a chronic illness. Luke was diagnosed shortly after birth with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that primarily affects his lungs, but also his intestines, pancreas and liver. Luke knows maintenance is the key to keep him healthy, so he doesn't complain about the eight breathing treatments, hour-long lung percussions or 30 medications he has to take daily. His community really rallied to help him feel like a normal kid. After school, you'll find Luke surrounded by his neighbors and playing video games while he completes his breathing treatment. Since Luke's diagnosis, his family members have become passionate advocates of cystic fibrosis research and treatment options. They often speak at events and participate in hospital fundraisers, encouraging donations that will give Luke the best chance at a long and healthy life.
                            </p><p>
                                Luke is a huge fan of the Kentucky Wildcats and Green Bay Packers.

                                After 2 failed attempts at IVF and countless tears and prayers, we had

                                3 frozen embryos left to use to try and get pregnant. These embryos were

                                not ideal from the beginning, and given our previous failed attempts with

                                better looking embryos, we had no hope of getting pregnant. In fact we had

                                an appointment already set up across the country to see a specialist and

                                try to start over. But March 21, 2014 we finally heard the words we had

                                been waiting over a year to hear "Congratulations, you are pregnant!" And

                                so was the start of our miracle baby.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pre-natal screening identified that mom was a CF carrier but follow up

                                testing on Dad for the 30 most common mutations revealed he was not a

                                carrier. We had an uneventful, wonderful pregnancy and after a very long

                                few days of labor and delivery, Samuel was born on December 1, 2014 at

                                3:38 in the morning. He was perfect, weighing in at the generous size of 9

                                lb 2 oz and went home from the hospital 2 days later.

                                One week after being home, while we were busy trying to figure out how to

                                be a mom and a dad we got a call saying that Samuel's newborn screen

                                came up positive and he may have cystic fibrosis. He had a follow up

                                sweat test and then on December 19th around 4 pm we got THE

                                CALL.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                THE CALL no parent wants to get. The CALL that tells you there is

                                something wrong with your baby, The CALL that says your baby is hurt,

                                The CALL that every parent dreads, The CALL that stops the whole world

                                and takes your breath away at the same time. We were brokenhearted, in

                                disbelief and we couldn't believe that God would do this to our baby. Mom

                                clutched her newborn to her chest and fell to the ground on the kitchen

                                floor screaming out and asking God why? This was the second Surprise

                                that little Samuel would bring to our lives.  This was the call that told us our

                                perfect baby had a deadly disease.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So there we were, going through the motions of daily life with a newborn

                                trying to wrap our heads around the fact that our perfect baby had a deadly

                                disease. We researched, started medications, found doctors and sought

                                out specialists. We learned how to do chest physical therapy, found

                                researchers willing to work with us and made new friends. We were angry

                                at God, yelled at God and thanked God all at the same time. And

                                somehow here we are, 9 months later, with a perfectly healthy baby boy.

                                He has grown well and has had no issues so far. We hope that with our

                                continued efforts, he will remain healthy.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our family has jumped in with both feet, and our extended family and

                                friends have jumped in with us. Team Samuel Strong has raised over

                                $20,000 this year to find a cure for Samuel and everyone else affected by

                                this disease. And, out of a labor of love, 3 families affected by this disease

                                created CRAFT. What will be known as one of the premier events in

                                Louisville year after year started from a few parents that just hope to see

                                their children live long, healthy, happy lives.

                            <h2>Alex's Story</h2>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/team/IMG_3221.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
                                One glance at Alex and you will see that she is a typical 2 ½ year old. She is energetic, happy, curious, and loving. She

                                loves to dance (to Taylor Swift), color, learn new things, and swim in the pool. She thinks bugs are gross, burps are

                                funny, and she doesn’t like her hair brushed – at all. She amazes us every single day with a new word or knowledge bit.

                                And she tries our patience with the usual toddler outbursts and attitudes.
                            </p><p>
                                If you watch long enough, though, you may see another side to this little girl. She is patient (most of the time), cautious

                                (usually), and incredibly brave (always). She sits through hours of therapy and breathing treatments each day. She takes

                                more medications than most adults (and has done so since she was just a few weeks old). Before meals and snacks, she

                                takes enzymes that help her body absorb nutrients from the food she eats; she takes special vitamins and other

                                medications as well. In the past year, Alex has spent around 8.9 days’ worth of time inhaling nebulized treatments to

                                help her breathe, endured close to 15 days’ worth of time doing vest therapy to keep her lungs clear, and taken almost

                                2,200 pancreatic enzymes to absorb nutrients from her meals. We work very hard (and diligently), and we are aggressive

                                with treatment to ensure that Alex stays as healthy as possible.
                            </p><p>
                                Alexandra Elaine was born in April 2013. It was a very easy pregnancy and an even easier birth. We stayed in the hospital

                                for a few days before being sent home as a new family of three. We were equally excited and scared – newborns can be

                                very intimidating to new parents! But Alex was a perfect baby – she loved to be held (but not swaddled!), slept, ate, and

                                rarely cried. At five days old, when we had our first visit to the pediatrician’s office for the usual well-baby checkup, we

                                were told that Alex was not back up to her birth weight. Slightly concerned, we were told to come back in another week

                                and not to worry. “This isn’t unusual,” they said. We returned the following week, expecting some weight gain.

                                However, despite feeding every two hours around the clock, Alex was diagnosed with ‘Failure to Thrive,’ as she still had

                                yet to get back up to her birth weight after nearly two weeks. The pediatrician had noted that she had some abnormal

                                findings with her newborn screening; the follow-up genetic testing later would confirm the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis

                                (CF).
                            </p><p>
                                We were crushed and confused – it came completely out of the blue. Neither side knew of any family history of this

                                disease. It was easily the most difficult day/week/month/year of our lives. Having a newborn is hard enough, but getting

                                that kind of diagnosis on top of it – well, it was definitely hard.

                                That same week, we took Alex to her first (of many) CF Clinic appointments where we met an amazing team of doctors,

                                nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers, and dieticians. We were able to start medications that same day and saw

                                an immediate improvement in weight gain – those medications saved her life. Within a week, Alex had gained more than

                                a few pounds. It was truly remarkable. Alex’s weight issue is caused by the inability of her body to release enzymes that

                                aid in the breakdown and absorption of the food she eats. It was such a great relief to see our baby girl beginning to

                                thrive!
                            </p><p>
                                We reached out to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) shortly after Alex’s diagnosis. We wanted to do something; but,

                                because there is currently no cure for this disease, we felt helpless. We began doing the only thing that we could think of

                                – raising money for the CF Foundation to aid in a fight for a medical breakthrough! Because Cystic Fibrosis is considered

                                an Orphan Disease, it does not get the attention of big pharmaceutical companies. Nobody is competing for the “Next

                                Big CF Drug” like they are for other, more prominent diseases (like heart disease or breast cancer). There is no major

                                incentive for companies to invest in CF research. Without the CFF and its aggressive efforts in eradicating Cystic Fibrosis,

                                we would not be able to enjoy our daughter like we do today. In the last two years, our family and friends alone have

                                raised over $63,000 for the CF Foundation. But this is not enough… In an effort to make an even bigger impact and

                                ensure that our daughter will have a bright and healthy future ahead, we decided to join forces with other families

                                fighting the same battle. When a group of CF parents get together – mighty things happen – and events like CRAFT are

                                born.
                            </p><p>
                                Alexandra means “Protector of Mankind” in Greek. Before Alex was born, we decided that we wanted a strong name for

                                our daughter – we just didn’t realize how strong she would be. Alexandra Elaine will definitely make miracles. We do not

                                treat her differently; we do not treat her special – she is our 2 ½ year old daughter: the typical toddler. We do not expect

                                pity, or sadness, or sorrow. We have felt these feelings in the past, but we have found that you can accomplish more

                                when you reroute that state of mind toward a more positive goal. We are extremely lucky to have a beautiful daughter –

                                there is only her future to celebrate!
